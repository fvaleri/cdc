## Connect CDC process

This is the KafkaConnect distributed mode architecture that we will configure to fit our use case.
```
SourceConnector --> KafkaConnectDM [Worker0JVM(TaskA0, TaskB0, TaskB1),...] --> SinkConnector
                                |
                    Kafka (offsets, config, status)
```

We will run all components on localhost, but ideally each one should run in a different host (physical, VM or container).
Connect workers operate well in containers and in managed environments. Take a look at the [Strimzi](https://strimzi.io)
project if you want to know how to easily operate Kafka and KafkaConnect on Kubernetes platform.

We need a Kafka cluster up and running (3 ZooKeeper + 3 Kafka). This step also download and install all required Connectors
(`debezium-connector-postgres`, `camel-sjms2-kafka-connector`) and dependencies.
```sh
./run.sh --kafka
# status check
ps -ef | grep "[Q]uorumPeerMain" | wc -l
ps -ef | grep "[K]afka" | wc -l
```

Now we can start our 3-nodes KafkaConnect cluster in distributed mode (workers that are configured with matching `group.id`
values automatically discover each other and form a cluster).
```sh
./run.sh --connect
# status check
ps -ef | grep "[C]onnectDistributed" | wc -l
tail -n100 /tmp/kafka/logs/connect.log
/tmp/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2180 --list
curl localhost:7070/connector-plugins | jq
```

The infrastructure is ready and we can finally configure our CDC pipeline.
```sh
# debezium source task (topic name == serverName.schemaName.tableName)
curl -sX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:7070/connectors -d @connect-cdc/src/main/connectors/dbz-source.json

# jms sink tasks (powered by sjms2 component)
curl -sX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:7070/connectors -d @connect-cdc/src/main/connectors/json-jms-sink.json
curl -sX POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" localhost:7070/connectors -d @connect-cdc/src/main/connectors/xml-jms-sink.json

# status check
curl -s localhost:7070/connectors | jq
curl -s localhost:7070/connectors/dbz-source/status | jq
curl -s localhost:7070/connectors/json-jms-sink/status | jq
curl -s localhost:7070/connectors/xml-jms-sink/status | jq
```

Produce some more changes and check queues.
```sh
./run.sh --stream
```

This is the change event produced by Debezium.
